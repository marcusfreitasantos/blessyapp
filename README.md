# BLESSY - MOBILE APP

This is a work in progress for a new mobile app that I am developing for churches.

## About the project

This application will work with a website in order to share dinamic content. The churches will be able to register their institution in the website and post content like musics, liturgy of the week/month, events and some other stuff. The user will see all of the registered churches based on their location or manually search by name or address and follow the church to get their notifications.

## The features are:

- User login and register
- Feed with most recent churches registered
- Church's profile
- List of events
- Music letters
- Save favorite churches in a bookmark area
- Search for churches by name or location
- Push notifications

## Built with

TypeScript | React Native | Expo | | Gluestack | Axios | Jest | Firebase

## Thanks for watching!!
